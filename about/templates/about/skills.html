    </h3>
    <p>
        Being a computer science engineer, I take interest in
        <span class="highlight">
            Development 
        </span> in general.
        Having had experience in
        <span class="highlight">
            Full Stack and Backend Development
        </span>
        , I can say that 
        <span class="highlight">
            Software, Application and Web Development 
        </span>
        are a few of my fields of interest.
        I also want to venture into fields like 
        <span class="highlight">
            Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics
        </span> that are so rapidly developing.
        Apart from these, I also take interest in 
        <span class="highlight">
            Human Psychology
        </span> as I'm truly fascinated by the subject and I also believe that it would be necessary at any point in life.
